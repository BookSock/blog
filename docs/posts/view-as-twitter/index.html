<p>Automatically make Twitter lists that mirror the follows of another twitter user. This will let you see something similar to what the other user&rsquo;s twitter feed sees. I think this could be cool for exploring other communities on twitter, or more easily generating Twitter lists for different subjects (like subreddits).</p>

<p>On the blog note:</p>

<p>Smartphone wallets - pretty awesome, but I feel like people ignore their value because the rubber ones are horrible or they think they need a phone case for their phone.</p>

<p>The rubber ones are bad, that&rsquo;s why you get something like this: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CardNinja-Ultra-slim-Adhesive-Credit-Smartphones/dp/B009ZVL7N4/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=phone+wallet&amp;qid=1560371201&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-5">https://www.amazon.com/CardNinja-Ultra-slim-Adhesive-Credit-Smartphones/dp/B009ZVL7N4/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=phone+wallet&amp;qid=1560371201&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-5</a></p>

<p>I also think phone cases are overrated. I used to drop my phone a lot as a kid, but for the past 5 years of having no phone case, I found that I rarely ever drop my phone anymore. Maybe this behavior change comes for free after going caseless and seeing your phone as more fragile. A skin like a dbrand phone skin may or may not be worth it though.</p>

<p>Now your phone is essentially as thin as the phone is without a case, and you don&rsquo;t need to carry a wallet on you. The dream.</p>
