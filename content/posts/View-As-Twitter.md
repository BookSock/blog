I made this:

Automatically make Twitter lists that mirror the follows of another twitter user. This will let you see something similar to what the other user's twitter feed sees. I think this could be cool for exploring other communities on twitter, or more easily generating Twitter lists for different subjects (like subreddits).

On the blog note:

Smartphone wallets - pretty awesome, but I feel like people ignore their value because the rubber ones are horrible or they think they need a phone case for their phone. 

The rubber ones are bad, that's why you get one of these: https://www.amazon.com/CardNinja-Ultra-slim-Adhesive-Credit-Smartphones/dp/B009ZVL7N4/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=phone+wallet&qid=1560371201&s=gateway&sr=8-5

And you don't need a phone case, because if you have insurance and use a dbrand phone skin, you'll prevent scratches, and in the rare occasion where you need to replace your phone due to damage, you'll still be covered.

Now your phone is essentially as thin as the phone is without a case, and you don't need to carry a wallet on you. A dream.
