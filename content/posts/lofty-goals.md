Fell off my loft this morning. The ladder was built to only sit loose on the bed frame and slipped as I was climbing down to turn off my alarm. I fell onto the ladder and sliced the inner ball of my foot.  Not even sure what my foot hit against, but my roommate and another
friend got my some gauze and a wrapped it before taking a Lyft and hopping to MIT Medical, where they put these pressure bandages on it
that I think they called stirrups. Then they wrapped it and gave me crutches. 

Missed my advisor meeting to submit my class registration, but am slowly finding times to call them throughout the day to finish the details.

At least this is probably one of the least serious ways I get to try
out crutches for the first time. I definitely didn't realize how
little effort walking is in comparison.

In terms of successes today - I woke up really fast. Reminds me of my roommate last year who wanted the top bunk so he could jump out of bed each day (onto a huge bean bag to break the fall) because it woke him up super fast. I definitely gonna try it now. Also I'm gonna build a new ladder that actually hooks onto the bed safely.

Back to things I read. I haven't been keeping track too well but some links I put in google keep to look at:
