      <description>I picked my classes last night and am satisfied I can use this semester as a foundation for doing a lot of interesting classes in the future. I heard from a MEng that they planned on rushing to taking a variety of grad classes so they could get exposure to lots of different fields at a higher level so they could decide what really interested them with better information than just some intro or header classes.</description>

      <description>Today I think I decided to be more serious about learning more math at MIT. Understanding things from the ground up has always been my favorite way to learn and more math should make that a reality hopefully.
I took a pretest for 6.031 and passed (I think) so now I don&amp;rsquo;t have to take 6.009. 6.031 is in Java, which I have never used before. Should be fun.
Fire show was lit (lol).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll start with lists of things I have read. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll add ratings or commentary in the future.
