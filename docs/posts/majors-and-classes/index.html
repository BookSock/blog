I took a pretest for 6.031 and passed (I think) so now I don&rsquo;t have to take 6.009. 6.031 is in Java, which I have never used before. Should be fun.
Fire show was lit (lol)." />

        <p>Today I think I decided to be more serious about learning more math at MIT.
Understanding things from the ground up has always been my favorite way to learn
and more math should make that a reality hopefully.</p>

<p>I took a pretest for 6.031 and passed (I think) so now I don&rsquo;t have to take 6.009.
6.031 is in Java, which I have never used before. Should be fun.</p>

<p>Fire show was lit (lol). (Spinning Arts at MIT)</p>

<p>Met my advisor and discussed how unplanned my semester was. I preregged
for 10 classes, and probably only really meant it for about 2 or 3 of them.
Advisor talk went super off topic discussing teaching styles, how students learn,
some cool studies related to teaching, how comedy/humor might affect teaching,
a super funny friend my advisor has that dominates WhatsApp, and then back to math
and goals and life. The best conversations are the ones that naturally take turn
after turn without missing a beat until the topic has changed so much that you
are struggling to recall that point you wanted to mention about that thing 2 or
 3 topics ago.</p>

<p>Met a ZBT alum in the elevator of stata who did two years in industry before
 coming back to do an MEng. Makes me think.</p>

<p>Thinking about 6-2, 18, and 8 (and 2 and 16 and 15 if it was more possible) as
 majors I want to get big chunks of at MIT.</p>
