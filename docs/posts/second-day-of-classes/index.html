        <p>I picked my classes last night and am satisfied I
can use this semester as a foundation for doing a lot of interesting classes in
 the future. I heard from a MEng that they planned on rushing to taking a variety
  of grad classes so they could get exposure to lots of different fields at a
   higher level so they could decide what really interested them with better
   information than just some intro or header classes. I think I will want to do
   the same after taking a lot of foundational classes this semester. First should
    come high level CS classes, and mixed in I can get some more EE, physics,
     and fun math classes in to be the foundation for high level EE classes.</p>

<p>Soon I will post more coherently, but I&rsquo;m shooting for consistency before effort
 since I&rsquo;ll want to know how both feel at some point and it&rsquo;s easier to start
  with consistency.</p>
